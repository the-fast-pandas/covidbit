        <p>This email is being sent to you on behalf of The Fast Pandas, 
        a group of aspiring software developers from Seneca College.<br>
        As we all know, the coronavirus pandemic has changed Canadian lives forever, 
        from how we live to how we work and how we interact with others. 
        It has had a particularly negative impact on local businesses.</p>
        <p> We have spent the last few months creating the COVIDBIT, 
        that we hope will relieve some of the pressure put on businesses during this time.<br>
        This platform will provide you with the opportunity to advertise your businessesâ€™ 
        safety measures, track infections and be certified as a safe business. <br>
        You can also expect to gain access to contact tracing methods and schedule appointments.</p>
        <p> We have selected your business to join our web application. <br>
        We hope that our project will provide relief to your business so that you can 
        continue to serve your community. <br>
        Feel free to contact us at this email if you 
        have any questions.</p> 
        <p> You can register in our website
        <a href="http://localhost:4200/registration-form/"> here </a> </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>  

        <p style="font-size:14px;color:darkblue;font-family: Georgia, serif;"><i>The Fast Pandas</i> <br>
        
        Creating a safer world together</p>`;
