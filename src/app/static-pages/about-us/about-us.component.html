                    We have spent the last few months creating the COVIDBIT, that we hope will relieve some of the
                    pressure put on businesses during this time.
                    This platform will provide small businesses with the opportunity to advertise their businessesâ€™
                    safety measures, track cases and be certified as a safe business.
                    It will also allow general users to make well-informed decisions.<br><br>
